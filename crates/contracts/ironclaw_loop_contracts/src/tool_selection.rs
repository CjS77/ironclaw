//! Tool selection port for the agent loop host.
//!
//! Turn-start tool selection decides which deferred tools a conversation
//! advertises in its request's `tools` array, beside the core tools and the
//! discovery bridges that progressive disclosure always advertises. The loop
//! host owns everything around that decision: which tools are candidates (the
//! authorized tools that are not already advertised), the bounds on the
//! conversation text, the durable record of the result, and what happens when
//! a selection fails. The decision itself, "which of these candidates", is
//! this port: [`ToolSelectionClassifier`].
//!
//! # Output is untrusted
//!
//! A classifier cannot grant authority. The host drops every returned name
//! that is not a candidate, duplicates and invalid scores, and stops adding
//! tools once [`ToolSelectionRequest::max_tools`] or
//! [`ToolSelectionRequest::token_budget`] is reached.
//!
//! # When a classifier runs
//!
//! Once per conversation: before the model call of the first turn that has
//! user text and no recorded selection. The result is recorded with the
//! conversation, and every later turn rebuilds the same list from that record
//! without calling the classifier, because the `tools` array is part of the
//! provider's cached prompt prefix.
//!
//! # Confidentiality contract
//!
//! The request carries user text ([`ConversationContext`]) and tool
//! descriptions. Implementations must not log either, and a
//! [`ToolSelectionError`] must never carry them. `Debug` on the request and
//! the context prints sizes only. A classifier that sends the request to a
//! third party must say so in its operator documentation.
//!
//! # Determinism contract
//!
//! For the same request a classifier should return the same selection, ties
//! broken by candidate (catalog) order. A remote model may not be exactly
//! reproducible; that is acceptable because the host records the result
//! instead of recomputing it.
