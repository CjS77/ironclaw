//! Jev as the turn-start tool classifier.
//!
//! [`JevToolClassifier`] implements `ironclaw_loop_contracts`'
//! `ToolSelectionClassifier` port with Jev, TypeSafe's hosted classification
//! model, reached through a configured decisions endpoint: TypeSafe's by
//! default, or any provider serving the same decisions API. For every
//! candidate tool it asks one `noul` question, "how likely is it that this
//! tool will be used in the following conversation, given its description?",
//! and keeps the tools with the highest probabilities. See this package's
//! `README.md` for the request shape, slicing, selection and failure rules.
//!
//! # Confidentiality
//!
//! Every request sends the conversation's user text (at most 16 KiB) and
//! every candidate tool's name, description and parameter names to the
//! configured Jev provider, a third party. Nothing runs on the host. Neither
//! the text sent, the answers received nor the API key is ever logged; errors
//! carry stable labels only.
//!
//! All HTTP goes through `ironclaw_network`'s policy egress, pinned to the
//! configured endpoint's host and port over HTTPS with private address
//! ranges denied.
